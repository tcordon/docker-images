Docker Image Templates for basic apps.

For now I have these templates:

| | | 
| :--- | :--- |
| [docker-web](https://github.com/tcordon/docker-images/tree/master/docker-web) | For a simple server with Apache+PHP7 |
| [docker-worker](https://github.com/tcordon/docker-images/tree/master/docker-worker) | For a simple server with PHP 7 to run command line Scripts |
| [docker-compose project](https://github.com/tcordon/docker-images/tree/master/docker-compose) | To run a simple Web server with an MQTT queue and some consumers |
